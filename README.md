## PYTHON SCRIPT TO AUTOMATICALLY CHANGE YOUR WALLPAPER EVERY 30MINS

## Getting Started:
1. Clone the repo:
    ```
    git clone https:\\github.com\chidubesteve\wallpaper_changer
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage:


1. Run the script on your local machine. This script fetches wallpapers from Reddit and sets them as your desktop background.

    ```bash
    python wallpaper_changer.py
    ```

2. The script will run indefinitely, changing your wallpaper every 30 minutes. To make it run when you startup your system:
- rename the python file to wallpaper_changer.pyw . This means the file creates no window.
- create a shortcut of the file
- Press Windows key + R and type ```shell:startup```
- Drag and drop the shortcut file into the new explorer window


### Note:

- Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

- If you encounter any issues, check the script for proper file paths and internet connectivity.

- The script uses the `requests` library for fetching data from Reddit. If not already installed, it will be automatically installed when running the `pip install` command.

- try printing the response and if you get an error that says `{"message": "Too Many Requests", "error": 429}` then, you can solve this by supplying  a user agent in the header. this site "https://www.whatismybrowser.com/guides/the-latest-user-agent/" provides info about the latest user agent for your browser. Refactor your code to include the header in your request like so 
```bash
myHeader = {
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/90.0.4430.85 Safari/537.36"
}
# MAKE SURE TO CHECK THE WEBSITE FOR THE LATEST INFO FOR YOUR BROWSER AND USER AGENT
textData = requests.get('https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpaper/new.json', headers=myHeader).content
```

- You need to adjust `%FILE_DESTIONATION_YOU_WANT_TO_STORE_THE_IMAGE%"` in the script to match your system's directory structure.

- For Windows users, the script assumes the use of backslashes (`\`) in file paths. Modify accordingly if using a different operating system.

- If you're using UNIX/LINUX check through this [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1977694/how-can-i-change-my-desktop-background-with-python) thread for the right library to use to store it on your disk as the `ctypes` module is for Windows user.
